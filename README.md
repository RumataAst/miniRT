miniRT is a graphics project at 42 that involves creating a simple ray tracer capable of rendering 3D scenes with basic geometric shapes, lighting, and shadows. The project introduces the fundamentals of ray tracing, including light behavior, reflection, and shadow casting, to produce realistic images from scratch using minimal libraries.

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Implement ray tracing algorithms to simulate light paths and produce realistic images
- Render 3D shapes (spheres, planes, cylinders) using mathematical formulas
- Calculate lighting effects like ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections
- Manage camera positioning, view transformations, and shadow calculations

I joined John (jcummins42p https://github.com/jcummins42p) who did majority of work. Likely i was able to learn from him and add additional functions such as rendering of cylinders, object movement.
